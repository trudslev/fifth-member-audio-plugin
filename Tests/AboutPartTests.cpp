/**
    `ABOUT-PART.md` against the real editor.

    **Why the assertions are here rather than in a capture.** Driving the standalone re-prompts for
    microphone permission on every rebuild, so there is no window until a human answers a dialog;
    and a capture's resolution is the display's, so the same figure changes instrument between
    machines. `nf::testing::renderComponent` runs the real paint path with neither problem. What it
    cannot see is anything the window server owns — focus, the cursor, z-order against other
    windows — so this file asserts geometry and writes an image for a person to look at, and does
    not claim to have tested the interaction.

    **The PNGs are the point of writing them at all.** A layer that is drawn, correct and invisible
    passes every assertion here: the About tab was under the panel for one build on Reflect-84,
    because JUCE paints children in the order they are added and the tab was registered beside its
    construction. Nothing in an assertion caught that. The image did.
